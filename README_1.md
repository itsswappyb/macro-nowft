# NowFT is a BNPL-Enabled NFT Marketplace.

## The Problem
1. NFT and GameFi is at the forefront of crypto adoption, however **most pieces are at a hard-to-reach price range**
2. Most NFT finance platforms **only benefit existing NFT holders** and neglect needs of aspiring NFT buyers

## Our Solution
NowFT - a permissionless P2P-based BNPL NFT marketplace, that delivers:
1. The needs of **aspiring NFT buyers by lowering the initial capital barrier**
2. **Desired benefits** to both sellers and buyer

## How NowFT Works
- Sellers could list their NFTs with a customised BNPL payment structure (base price, minimum down payment, loan duration, interest)
- Buyers could purchase listed NFTs based on the set terms and make scheduled payments
  - After the first payment (down payment), the NFT is escrowed in a timelock contract
  - The buyer makes periodical payments to the contract and once the payment has been completed, the NFT is released to the buyer’s wallet
- In case of default (or late payment), the NFT and the current cumulative payment is released to the seller’s wallet
