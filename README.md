# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Running application

- Install root level dependencies by running `yarn`.
- cd into `ui` and install dependecies by running `yarn`.
- To run the `ui`, run `yarn dev` from `ui`.
